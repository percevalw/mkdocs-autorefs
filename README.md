Automatically link across pages in MkDocs.

## Installation

With `pip`:
```bash
python3 -m pip install mkdocs-autorefs
```

## Usage

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
  - search
  - autorefs
```

If a heading title that appears several times throughout the site, set the priority parameter to decide which page will be linked. The priority list follows the gitignore syntax and is tested in reverse: each anchor will be assigned the lowest priority amongst all of its matches.

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
  - search
  - autorefs:
    priority:
      - '*' # priority to all files
      - reference # except reference/... files 
```

In one of your Markdown files (e.g. `doc1.md`) create some headings:

```markdown
## Hello, world!

## Another heading

Link to [Hello, World!](#hello-world) on the same page.
```

This is a [*normal* link to an anchor](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#linking-to-pages). MkDocs generates anchors for each heading, and they can always be used to link to something, either within the same page (as shown here) or by specifying the path of the other page.

But with this plugin, you can **link to a heading from any other page** on the site *without* needing to know the path of either of the pages, just the heading title itself.  
Let's create another Markdown page to try this, `subdir/doc2.md`:

```markdown
We can [link to that heading][hello-world] from another page too.

This works the same as [a normal link to that heading](../doc1.md#hello-world).
```

Linking to a heading without needing to know the destination page can be useful if specifying that path is cumbersome, e.g. when the pages have deeply nested paths, are far apart, or are moved around frequently. And the issue is somewhat exacerbated by the fact that [MkDocs supports only *relative* links between pages](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1592).

## Requirements

mkdocs-autorefs requires Python 3.7 or above.
